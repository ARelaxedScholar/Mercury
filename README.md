# Mercury: A PocketFlow Clone in Rust

**License**: MIT | **Docs**

## Why? Because I could. And because Python is for the weak 
#### (Jk, I love you Python, <3).

You looked at PocketFlow and thought, "100 lines? That's cute. But is it *memory-safe*?"

You crave the sweet agony of the borrow checker. You yearn for the moral superiority that comes with writing everything in Rust. You, my friend, are a true masochist. And this is the LLM framework for you.

Mercury is a line-by-line, crate-by-painstaking-crate translation of PocketFlow into the best programming language, Rust.


### Features:

*   **Blazingly Fast?** Probably. I haven't benchmarked it. But it's in Rust, so it *feels* faster.
*   **Zero Dependencies?** Laughed in Cargo. But we try to keep it minimal.
*   **100 Lines?** When you think about it, what is a 100? And what is a line... No.
*   **Agentic Coding?** Let the compiler be your agent. It will tell you all the ways you've failed.

### Get Started (If You Dare)

To install, simply clone the repo and prepare for a fight with the borrow checker.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mercury.git
cd mercury
cargo run --example chat
```

### Why Mercury?

Look, we all know the real reason you're here. You saw a perfectly good, simple framework in Python and thought, "I could make this more difficult for myself." You're the kind of person who hears "rewrite it in Rust" and gets a little tingle down your spine. This is your calling.

| Abstraction | App-Specific Wrappers | Vendor-Specific Wrappers | Lines | Size | Why You Suffer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LangChain** | Many | Many | 405K | +166MB | Because you like bloat. |
| **CrewAI** | Many | Many | 18K | +173MB | You enjoy the company of others. |
| **Mercury** | None | None | 100ish | `target/` is 3GB | **Because pain is a feature.** |

### How does Mercury work?

It works through the sheer force of will and the guiding hand of the Rust compiler. You will learn about ownership, borrowing, and why your strings have mysteriously disappeared.

**"But the Reddit thread said it would be memory-safe."**

Yes. And it is. Now go fight the compiler for six months.

**Want to learn Agentic Coding?** Ask `rustc`. It has opinions.
