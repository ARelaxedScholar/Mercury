# Orichalcum: A PocketFlow Clone in Rust

**License**: MIT | **Docs**

## Status

⚠️ This library is in early development (0.x). The API may change.

## Why? Because I could. And because Python is for the weak 
#### (Jk, I love you Python, <3).

You looked at PocketFlow and thought, "100 lines? That's cute. But is it *memory-safe*?"

You crave the sweet agony of the borrow checker. You yearn for the moral superiority that comes with writing everything in Rust. You, my friend, are a true masochist. And this is the LLM framework for you.

Orichalcum is a spiritual son to PocketFlow, inheriting (ironically) the philosophy of PocketFlow, while changing a few things here and there. 


### Features:

*   **Blazingly Fast?** Probably. I haven't benchmarked it. But it's in Rust, so it *feels* faster.
*   **Zero Dependencies?** Laughed in Cargo. But we try to keep it minimal.
*   **100 Lines?** When you think about it, what is a 100? And what is a line... No.
*   **Agentic Coding?** Let the compiler be your agent. It will tell you all the ways you've failed.

### Get Started
```Rust
use orichalcum::sync::{Node, Flow, ...}
```

### Why Orichalcum?
I don't know. It sounded like a cool project?
I'll use it for agentic development down the line and I thought writing my own tools would be cool.

### How does Orichalcum work?
It as the same philosophy as PocketFlow (or at least my understanding of it), 
with a hard focus on composition rather than inheritance.
